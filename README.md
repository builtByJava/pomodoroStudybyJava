# pomodoroStudybyJava

Hi There!

I wanted to build a simple, yet effective tool to help me with time management while I'm studying or completing development tasks at work. The purpose of this project is simply for that by utilizing the pomodoro time management strategy. 

This project will give the user options in seleting their time ranges, ability to stop the clock at any moment, restart it, and then finally reset it. My goal when further enhancing this project in the future is to utilize plain vanilla JavaScript and JQuery. I want to stay away from modern frameworks and keep things simple and clean. Thanks!

Best,
Dan
